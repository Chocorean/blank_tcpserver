# blank\_tcpserver

An empty implementation for a Rust TCP server

This piece of code *looks a lot like* the one in the chapter 19 of The Rust Book.

Here may appear a guide one day about how to use this to write a custom TCPServer, with a proper communication protocol with its clients.

## Implement your own

Clone this repository and add an `upstream` remote:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Chocorean/blank_tcpserver.git -o upstream <dir_name>
cd <dir_name>
git remote add origin <remote_url>
```

Do your stuff:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "..."
git push origin main
```

Later, update your local repository with the latest changes:

```bash
git fetch
git checkout main
git rebase upstream/main
```
